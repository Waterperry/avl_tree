# avl_tree

This is a fully functioning AVL Tree. The code is split into two header files and a test driver function (main.c).


*The two header files (avl_tree.h and avl_node.h) contain the code for the AVL Tree.*

The avl_node.h header file is all internal code and does not contain any API functions.

The avl_tree.h header file contains some API functions and some internal functions (API functions are clearly
listed at the top).
